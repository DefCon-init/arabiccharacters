# Introduction

The dataset is composed of 16800 Arabic characters written by 60 participants in the age range of 19-40. We choose to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. Firstly, we will prepare the data (handwritten digits images) then we will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation. We achieved 99.671% of accuracy with CNN trained model. For computational reasons, we set the number of steps (epochs) to 2. This Notebook follows three main parts: The data preparation The CNN modeling and evaluation The results prediction and submission

The [notebook](https://github.com/DefCon-init/arabiccharacters/blob/master/Deep_Learning_with_CNNs.ipynb) is a google colab file which contains the steps to run the python files and the link to get download the dataset.
